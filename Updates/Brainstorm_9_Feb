Dear God,

Today is 9th Feb,Life is Going on Really Hectic and really new things are
Happening in my life , so i just fear you that the things we are doing 
now will not gonna ruin our future. Also Life is going really fast on the pace
things are going , we are evolving and our relationships are day by day 
Evolving So Yea,i know life is upto you and it's about your limits and 
Priorities and how your principles of life are , that's what life is really
so I am realy shocked about life as the today experience was really new
and kind of wierd and life chandiging as it  really changed my perspective 
towards the life. 

You know it's okay to do the things that you are fear to , as life will change
your perspective on the life will fully changed.
Thank you God
