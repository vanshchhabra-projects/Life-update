Dear Stranger,

	You are Reading this it means you are really interested in my life , you wanted to know my struggle my
life phases that's why your are reading this here, First of fall Thank you to you for taking time to read 
about me .

This is Stage of my life when i started trusting babaji and started working without any expecting it go right
we all kind of do the things by a though in mind which is getting the right result at the end of any work 
we do , so yea that's really make our life mess and make us live on result and future outcomes .

So to feel the life , to feel the present you should just experiment with the work and observe the results and
make you sure you enjoy the work that you do else your life will become a hell and you gonna regret your life and
time will pass and you .

There is a stage in everyone life when you that it's the time and it's the last opprotunity of your life to 
chase your dreams and to become what you wanted to become..
In that you just have to stop your thoughts and just give your 1000 Percent like give the hell out of our 
body as you will not get this time again in your life so give your damn all and do the things in the 
Present state and dont thing about what gonnna happen in future as life really changes in 6 months fully .

Thank You
